# RadioCore_Kit

RadioCore_Kit is the shared Arduino library for RadioCore series hardware.
It provides compile-time board configuration used by portable, board-adaptive
examples.

## Installation

Open Library Manager in the Arduino IDE, search for `RadioCore_Kit`, and select
**Install**. Arduino CLI users can install the library with:

```sh
arduino-cli lib install RadioCore_Kit
```

For development versions that have not been released, clone or copy this
repository into the `libraries` directory of your Arduino sketchbook, then
restart the Arduino IDE if it is already running.

Sketches can include the library with:

```cpp
#include <RadioCore_Kit.h>
```

## Dependencies

The library declares these Arduino dependencies:

- `Adafruit BME280 Library`
- `BH1750` version 1.3.0 or newer from
  [claws/BH1750](https://github.com/claws/BH1750)
- `SparkFun MMC5983MA Magnetometer Arduino Library` version 1.1.5 or newer
  for the onboard MMC5983MA magnetometer
- `ICM42670P` version 1.0.8 or newer from TDK InvenSense as the compatible
  driver used by the onboard ICM42607P example
- `Adafruit NeoPixel`
- `ESP32Servo` for ESP32-based RadioCore boards
- `NonBlockingRTTTL` version 1.4.0 or newer for non-blocking buzzer melodies

Dependency-aware Arduino tools can install these libraries automatically.
RadioCore_Kit does not copy, wrap, or re-export them.

The Heltec nRF52 board package supplies the Arduino official `Servo` library
used by `Servo_Control` on RC52; no separate Servo library installation is
required.

`NV3001B_Display` additionally requires the NV3001B-enabled
[Quency-D/Arduino_GFX](https://github.com/Quency-D/Arduino_GFX) fork. Install
that fork manually in the Arduino sketchbook `libraries` directory. It is not
listed in `library.properties` because NV3001B support has not been merged into
the Arduino Library Manager version of `GFX Library for Arduino`.

`DEPG1020BNS770F1_Display` and `E0213A367_Display` require the development
version of `heltec-eink-modules` containing the external RD02E constructors and
RC52 platform support. Install that version manually until the changes are
available in a published Library Manager release.

## Examples

Open the examples from `File > Examples > RadioCore_Kit` in the Arduino
IDE. Board configuration macros select the supported pins and peripherals at
compile time.

Guided examples include their dependencies, wiring, board differences, runtime
behavior, and applicable calibration or limitation notes. Basic examples keep
their essential connection and safety notes in the sketch header.

## Adding a board configuration

Add a hardware-facts-only header under `src/boards/`, then select it from
`src/RadioCoreBoardConfig.h`. Keep peripheral initialization and example
behavior out of the board header.

A new board declares only the capabilities it supports:

- Sensor I2C instance, pins, frequency, and optional sensor-power control for
  `BH1750_Read`.
- Onboard MMC5983MA and ICM42607P capability flags plus any shared sensor-reset
  pin and release level required by their examples.
- ADC pins and optional power controls for `CH01_Read`, `VO01_Read`,
  `CO01_Read`, and `Soil_Moisture_Read`; CO01 also requires its control pin.
- NV3001B pins, active levels, SPI frequency, and one supported display
  transport for `NV3001B_Display`.
- RD02E driver-board pins and active levels for the shared paged
  DEPG1020BNS770F1 and E0213A367 examples. Document the connector mapping and
  shared-pin conflicts.
- A rotary encoder I2C address and phase masks for `Rotary_Encoder`, plus an
  independently declared user-button pin, active level, and input mode. The
  current RC32 and RC52 mappings share the configured Sensor I2C bus and power
  rail.
- A data pin for `WS2812`, a buzzer output pin and any shared peripheral power
  control required by `Buzzer_Control`, two motor-driver inputs for
  `Motor_Control`, a relay output and active level for `Relay_Control`, and two
  PWM pins plus driver enable facts for `Servo_Control`.

The shared examples currently support the ESP32/WiFi Kit Series and Heltec
nRF52 peripheral APIs used by RC32, RCC6, and RC52. A board with a different
I2C, ADC, SPI, or servo API may require a new architecture path in the relevant
example.

Unknown boards can still include `RadioCore_Kit.h`. All example capability macros
default to disabled, and an unsupported example reports its missing capability
during preprocessing.
